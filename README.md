# ðŸš— Driver Drowsiness Detection System

A machine learning project implemented in Google Colab to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on images of open/closed eyes and yawning, and can trigger an alert when signs of drowsiness are detected.


## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Real-time driver monitoring.
- CNN-based classification of:
  - Open eyes
  - Closed eyes
  - Yawn
  - No-yawn
- Alarm trigger for drowsiness detection.


## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The model is trained on the "yawn_eye_dataset_new"
